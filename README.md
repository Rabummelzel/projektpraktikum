# Project work at MPIK
You can find my IPython notebook in the protokoll folder.  
To work with the notebook you need to install the following python packages with (may need pip first): 
```
pip3 install jupyter numpy scipy plotly
```
and then run
```
jupyter notebook
```
and select the ipynb file inside the protokoll folder.
