How to use the Arduino temperature control:

After plugging in the Arduino it will show the IP-adress over the serial output,
which can be read out with the Arduino IDE serial monitor (after selecting the
right port). Should this IP somehow not be the same as in the script it has to
be adjusted in the script (directly at the beginning of client.py).
Now the client.py script can be started. Best start it like this:

python3 client.py & disown

Then it will run in the background and not get shut down after logging out.
Now the client will save the data from the Arduino serial output to the file
called temp.dat.
To send a command run the controller.py script:

python3 controller.py command

For the commands see the protokoll.pdf under the section controlling the pid.
The message returned will be shown in the terminal and also saved in the
tempreg.log file. Should errors be produced by the client script they will also
be saved in this file.
